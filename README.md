# GifTastic

#_about_

GifTastic is a simple app using the Giphy API.
Allowing the user to push pre-generated topics (90's cartoons) and recieve gifs pertaining to that subject matter. As well the user can create buttons of there own, referring to any subject matter, and recieve gifs for that subject. 

Each gif will have a rating above there them, allowing the user to know what to expect from the content matter. 

The default amount of gifs the user will recieve is 10, but I added a button, that will stack 10 more gifs onto that output. The button can be clicked in succession so the user can get any amount (as long Multiple of 10) they'd like, but only for that button click. The limit is reset to 10 on the next button click for new material.
